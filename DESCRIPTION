Title: Functional profiling of somatic variation

Description: Given a number of samples containing somatic variants, e.g. 
    obtained by genome sequencing of patients with different cancer types,
    FPSV quantifies the enrichment of variants with respect to different 
    functional groups (hallmark processes, pathways, gene ontology sets).
    This enables quantitative comparison of the different samples.
